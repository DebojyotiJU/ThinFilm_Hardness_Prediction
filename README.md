# ThinFilm_Hardness_Prediction
A machine-learning framework that predicts Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of steels using composition + heat-treatment + processing parameters. The dataset is synthetically generated using metallurgy-based rules (Hall–Petch, tempering response, quenching behavior, composition strengthening).
